University of Waterloo Formula Motorsports
==========================================
A git repository for projects for the University of Waterloo Formula
Motorsports. This repository is intended to provide a one-stop source
for any tools I've developed for the team.

Projects
========
* fsaem_history - FSAE Michigan History. Plotter scripts to visualize competition data.
* ymd - Yaw Moment Diagram. Implements Pacejka MF5.2 to generate a YMD.

Why Open Source?
================
There are several reasons why I'm putting my code up on GitHub. Firstly,
it's so the code is always available. There would be nothing worse than
to write a whole bunch of code, have it undiscovered on the team drive
and never used. Perhaps the second reason is the more interesting, is
that I hope that the Formula SAE community can benefit from having an
open implementation of common simulations. Formula SAE is a competition
for the benefit of students around the world, so if you are visiting
from another school - welcome! I hope you find something useful in this
repository and learn something along the way.
